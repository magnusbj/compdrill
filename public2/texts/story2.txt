Title: Industrialization and lean well construction
Slug: We humans are best at improving and solving challenges, routine and repetition is challenging for us as we get tired and is prone to make mistakes.
Content: The current technology for drilling rigs and drilling and well technology is designed to be handled by people, with many manual processes and a level of monitoring and precision that seems poor compared to other industries. You wouldn't buy a mass produced car if you knew the quality depended on somebody's skill-set, experience and mood, and you probably find the cost of the car competitive.

By use modern and advanced materials such as composites, the well construction process can be simplified in terms of labor intensity and costs, and at the same time increase efficiency and presicion.
