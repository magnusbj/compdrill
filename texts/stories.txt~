Title: Drill and complete wells in weeks, not months
Slug: Significant increase in drilling and completion efficiency with modern materials
Content: Steel has been the construction and engineering material in the oil industry since the beginning of commercial oil production. As the industry has grown, steel has always been the material of choice, and machinery and drilling rigs has grown larger and stronger to carry the loads. As wells has become more complex in increasingly challenging reservoirs, the limitations of using steel in all downhole applications is becoming evident. To cut costs and increase efficiency of drilling and well operations, it is cruxial to 
 * reduce cost of logistics
 * reduce cost of drilling machinery, and
 * increase efficiency of well construction.

To make a leap forward in drilling and well construction cost and efficiency, we challenge ourselves to find solutions with new materials and deliver concepts that outpace conventional drilling technologies based on steel and always larger machinery.
Title: Industrialization and lean well construction
Slug: We humans are best at improving and solving challenges, routine and repetition is challenging for us as we get tired and is prone to make mistakes.
Content: The current technology for drilling rigs and drilling and well technology is designed to be handled by people, with many manual processes and a level of monitoring and precision that seems poor compared to other industries. You wouldn't buy a mass produced car if you knew the quality depended on somebody's skill-set, experience and mood, and you probably find the cost of the car competitive.

By use modern and advanced materials such as composites, the well construction process can be simplified in terms of labor intensity and costs, and at the same time increase efficiency and presicion.
