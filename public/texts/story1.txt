Title: Drill and complete wells in weeks, not months
Slug: Significant increase in drilling and completion efficiency with modern materials
Content: Steel has been the construction and engineering material in the oil industry since the beginning of commercial oil production. As the industry has grown, steel has always been the material of choice, and machinery and drilling rigs has grown larger and stronger to carry the loads. As wells has become more complex in increasingly challenging reservoirs, the limitations of using steel in all downhole applications is becoming evident. To cut costs and increase efficiency of drilling and well operations, it is cruxial to 
 * reduce cost of logistics
 * reduce cost of drilling machinery, and
 * increase efficiency of well construction.

To make a leap forward in drilling and well construction cost and efficiency, we challenge ourselves to find solutions with new materials and deliver concepts that outpace conventional drilling technologies based on steel and always larger machinery.
